Pokémon Yume 夢 Red/Green/Blue is an enhancement hack of Pokémon Red and Blue built on the [pokered disassembly](https://github.com/pret/pokered).
It aims to enrich the originals with improved gameplay balance, greater Pokémon accessibility, and carefully integrated additions that feel as though they were always meant to be there.
Above all, it seeks to preserve the charm and spirit of these beloved games.

夢 (Yume), meaning dream, symbolizes a return to Kanto where the line between memory and reimagination blurs.
Loosely inspired by the anime, manga, and later Pokémon generations, Yume features expanded storylines, new areas, and subtle cultural touches highlighting the games' Japanese roots.

### What's new?

- **Catch 'em all!** All original 151 Pokémon are available through natural gameplay.
- **Play as Red or Green.** Adventure as a girl or a boy.
- **Revisit Kanto.** Explore new areas like the Cinnabar Volcano, the Saffron Pokémon Academy, Celadon Grove... and even an all-new Mandarin Island!
- **Expanded Postgame.** New quests, Elite Four rematches, Gen 2 tie-ins, a restored Prof. Oak battle, and more!
- **Mew quest.** A proper storyline leading to the Mythical Pokémon.
- **Quality-of-life improvements.** Running shoes, bigger bag space, easier HM usage, experience bars, repel reuse prompts, a move deleter, and much more.

### Gameplay updates

**Moves**
- Several moves have been parsimoniously reworked in order to increase their viability while trying to maintain the original feeling of the game. Three moves from later generations have been added.
- Consult the [complete list of move changes](docs/move_changes.md) for more info!
- Ghost is now a Special type, and Dragon a Physical type.
- Fix for Focus energy and Dire hit. (Quadruple critical hit rate instead of dividing it by 4.)

**Learnsets**
- Pokémon learnsets have been revamped in the same spirit: to give more options while trying to maintain Gen 1 authenticity.
- The new learnsets can be consulted in this [file](data/pokemon/evos_moves.asm).
- Stone and trade evolutions keep learning moves.

**Battles**
- Gym leaders' and Elite 4 members' Pokémon have better moves overall.
- Several Gym leader teams were slightly modified (but trying to keep their theme intact!).
- The rival's teams now include a more diverse roster to better reflect his storyline.
- New trainers to fight in new and existing areas. (You may recognize some from the anime!)
- Rematches for Gym leaders and the Elite 4 with stronger teams and movesets!
- A new **Battle Hall** with random 3vs3 battles.

**Wild encounters**
- Wild encounters have been reworked to increase diversity and make many Pokémon available earlier in the game.
- For full details (spoilers!), see the files for [wild encounters on each map](data/wild/maps) and their [probabilities](data/wild/probabilities.asm).
- Every fishing rod is available earlier than it was in the original games.
- Fishing encounters were completely reworked in terms of levels and Pokémon diversity.
- For full details (spoilers!), see the files for the [Old rod](data/wild/old_rod.asm), [Good rod](data/wild/good_rod.asm) and [Super rod](data/wild/super_rod.asm).
- The Area feature of the Pokédex now shows Land, Surf, and Fishing encounters separately.
- A new NPC gives the fossil you didn't choose in Mt. Moon later in the game.
- Either Hitmonlee or Hitmonchan is also obtainable from a new NPC before the Elite 4.

### New content

**Maps**
- New zones including Mandarin Island, Cinnabar Volcano, Saffron Pokémon Academy, Mt. Moon square, Celadon Grove... and more.
- Take the brand-new Citrus ferries from Vermilion to Mandarin Island.
- Refurbished Pokécenters! Modern layout with the PC next to the nurse, sleeker design.
- New Celadon Mart floor where PP-related items are sold in the postgame (Ether, Elixir, PP Up...).

**Story**
- Postgame quests around each Elite 4 member to unlock their rematches.
- A hidden location and adversary to unlock after battling Prof. Oak.
- New secrets in the Cinnabar Mansion could lead you to meet the Mythical Pokémon, Mew.
- Plenty of extra dialogue, woven naturally into old and new locations.

**Visual updates**

- New player sprites when surfing or running.
- In SuperGameBoy mode, the town color palettes have been adjusted to better reflect the original Japanese town names.
